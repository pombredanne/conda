Create a new conda environment from a list of specified packages. To use the created environment, use 'source activate envname' look in that directory first.  This command requires either the -n NAME or -p PREFIX option.

**usage**: ``conda create [-h] [--yes] [--dry-run] [-f FILE] [--clone ENV] [-c CHANNEL] [--override-channels] [-n NAME | -p PATH] [-q] [package_spec [package_spec ...]]``

*package_spec*
        specification of package to install into new environment

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --yes                 do not ask for confirmation
  --dry-run             only display what would have been done
  -f FILE, --file FILE  filename to read package specs from
  --clone ENV           path to (or name of) existing environment
  -c CHANNEL, --channel CHANNEL
                        additional channel to search for packages. These are searched in the order they are given, and then the defaults or channels from .condarc (unless --override-channels is given). You can use 'defaults' to get the default packages for conda, and 'system' to get the system packages, which also takes .condarc into account.
  --override-channels   Do not search default or .condarc channels. Requires --channel.
  -n NAME, --name NAME  name of environment (in /home/ilan/a150/envs)
  -p PATH, --prefix PATH
                        full path to environment prefix (default: /home/ilan/a150)
  -q, --quiet           do not display progress bar

examples:
    conda create -n myenv sqlite
