Update conda packages.

**usage**: ``conda update [-h] [--yes] [--dry-run] [-n NAME | -p PATH] [-q] [-c CHANNEL] [--override-channels] [package_name [package_name ...]]``

*package_name*
        names of packages to update

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --yes                 do not ask for confirmation
  --dry-run             only display what would have been done
  -n NAME, --name NAME  name of environment (in /home/ilan/a150/envs)
  -p PATH, --prefix PATH
                        full path to environment prefix (default: /home/ilan/a150)
  -q, --quiet           do not display progress bar
  -c CHANNEL, --channel CHANNEL
                        additional channel to search for packages. These are searched in the order they are given, and then the defaults or channels from .condarc (unless --override-channels is given). You can use 'defaults' to get the default packages for conda, and 'system' to get the system packages, which also takes .condarc into account.
  --override-channels   Do not search default or .condarc channels. Requires --channel.

examples:
    conda update -p ~/anaconda/envs/myenv scipy
